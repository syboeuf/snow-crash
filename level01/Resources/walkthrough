Upon running /etc/passwd | grep flag01  we find an encrypted password linked to the user flag01 as follows :

flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

We store this information in a file which will then be used with john the ripper :

/etc/passwd | grep flag01 > pass

john -show pass

Gives us :

flag01:abcdefg:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

The password of flag01 is then : abcdefg
