The binary level08 reads a file and outputs it's content on the standard input.

Running the binary on the file named "token" outputs an error : 

You may not access 'token'

Further inspection with gdb shows us that the program calls strstr() and thus, stops if the file provided is named "token" :

0x080485ba <+102>:	call   0x8048400 <strstr@plt>

In order to bypass the strstr() check on the file token, we create a symbolic link :

ln -s /home/user/level08/token /tmp/tok

Running the level08 again on /tmp/tok gives us the password for flag08 :
