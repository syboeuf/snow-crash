Running the level13 binary outputs :

UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242

Inspecting with gdb we notice :

0x0804859a <+14>:    cmp    $0x1092,%eax
0x0804859f <+19>:    je     0x80485cb <main+63>

The program will continue if eax is equal to 0x1092.

The solution is then to modify eax to 0x1092 :

b main
b * 0x0804859a
r
c
set $eax=0x1092
n
