Checking the values in gdb of the level07 binary, we can see that getenv(), asprintf() and system() are used.

The system() function uses this string as a parameter when running the program :

/bin/echo level07

We can safely assume that this value was taken from an environment variable.

Modifying the LOGNAME value and running the program again outputs the new LOGNAME value.

This means we can change the LOGNAME value so that the level07 binary runs a binary file:

export LOGNAME=';getflag'
