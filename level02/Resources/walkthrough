Searching information about pcap files indicates us that this file extension is most often used with wireshark.

After installing wireshark, we copy the pcap file in order to analyse it's traffic.

scp -P 4242 level02@IP:/home/user/level02/level02.pcap .

Upon inspection by doing Follow TCP stream, we notice this line :

Password: ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L

By checking the values in hex format in wireshark, we notice that the non printable characters ('.') correspond to 7f in the ascii table, in this case the DELETE key.

Therefore, we can tell the password for flag02 is :

ft_waNDReL0L
